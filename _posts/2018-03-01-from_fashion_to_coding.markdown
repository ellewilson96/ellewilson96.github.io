"Wow, you're doing that? But, you have to be a *genius* to learn coding!"

I enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology four years ago. In that four years, I learned a tremendous amount about how the industry works - both from school experience and real-world experience. Eventually, my real-world experience and my school experience led in different directions, and this is where I began to feel disillusioned. As most of us know, retail is steadily declining in favor of innovative companies such as Amazon. I experienced this first-hand, as the retail store I've worked at for two years went from a glamorous illusion, to a stark reality. 

The future of fashion may be optimistic with new technologies and in-store experiences; however, it is going to require a massive overhaul for people to be excited about fashion again. Everybody I know is overworked and underpaid, and upon realizing this, I had to make a quick detour on my career path.

I began researching coding schools during my Fall 2017 semester, knowing that if I didn't act on this thought immediately, I would have a full-time job and would struggle to commit the time required to learn how to code. I found many schools that seemed promising, however what really helped was actually a Reddit thread that reviewed coding bootcamps. It is somewhat trendy to be in a coding bootcamp for those of us in-the-know, but they are trendy for fantastic reason. Most programs guarantee some sort of return on investment, which I thought was really important. Flatiron School in particular has an amazing Money-Back Guarantee, where if they don't place you in a job in six months, you will receive all of your tuition back. This is what made the school stand out to me, and after doing plenty of research, I decided to apply.

Luckily, my application adviser had also come from a background in textile design, so she completely understood the transition and I was accepted into the Online Web Developer program!

There is just so much more opportunity in this field. Any company, as long as they have a website or any form of software, will have a team of developers. This means I can work for a fashion company in the future, especially when technology is becoming integrated into retail experiences more than ever. Applications are also incredibly important. I simply see more opportunity moving in this direction, and I am so grateful that I am living in a time where coding bootcamps are even available! 

Looking forward to completing the program and I am so excited to learn a set of skills that I believe will be fundamental in the future.
