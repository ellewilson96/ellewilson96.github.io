Wow. I really can't believe I created my first web application. 

I loved learning Sinatra because I found that everything started to make sense to me once it was connected to the web. 

This project was definitely easier than the CLI Gem Project. After spending so many hours trying to figure out how to even get set up for the CLI Gem Project, I was able to get started on this project fairly quickly. Setting up the environment was so familiar to me by this point, and I had watched Avi's video on creating a Sinatra application from scratch which was really helpful. There were so many resources this time to really solidify my understanding of Sinatra, so I felt pretty comfortable. 

One of my biggest resources for reference was the Sinatra Fwitter App, which helped me get the foundation for my own project. Referencing this lab helped me make sure my users were able to log in and sign up, and I figured everything else out from there. I searched different inputs for HTML forms, where I was able to figure out how to implement a scrollbar with choices, rather than using text for input. 

Some of the issues I had along the way were easily solvable to me, which had me feeling pretty proud: 
- Changing the flights page to reflect ONLY the logged in user's flights
- Making sure the sign up page redirects properly
- Changing "flights scheduled" to "flight scheduled" if the user only selected one flight
- Using migrations to adjust my flights table when I realized I needed a user_id column
- Made sure all pages flowed with appropriate redirects to reflect an actual user experience

All in all, I felt great about completing this project and it really solidified my knowlede of ActiveRecord migrations, HTML basics, and routes/controllers.  I really felt I could get creative and I tried to keep the page flow as authentic to a user experience as possible. It was fun making sure everything made sense and I'm excited to begin Rails!
