I think I say this about every project, but this project was the hardest task I've ever had to accomplish at my time at Flatiron School. I think I worked on this project for about 8 weeks. After many weeks of frustration and hard work, I feel that I am just about finished with this project.

I learned an incredible amount throughout working on this project. At the start, I had rushed to catch up as I was in the Beta Cohort Program, and most weeks I was way behind. Because I had rushed, my Javascript, AJAX and Jquery skills were really not where they could have been. As such, I had to spend a lot of time reading documentation, learning on my own, re-watching all of the lectures, etc., to feel confident enough to work on this project.

What I really struggled with was the whole process of using Javascript to change the appearance of a webpage. The concepts are quite difficult to grasp, but after working on enough examples, I was able to get the hang of things. I now feel like I could articulate how I got from A to B, whereas before I had no idea what I was doing or how I got there.

I also learned so much about CSS. Since I started a completely new application, I wanted it to look great and flow well. I came up with a more realistic idea - beauty products and reviews - and got to work. I taught myself so much about sectioning the page with div's, working with flexbox, and more. Because I work full-time and was in school for most of the Flatiron program, the projects really help to solidify what I've been learning. 

This project was incredibly hard, and I still don't feel completely done. I am looking foward to learning about React, and I'm very proud for how far I've come.
