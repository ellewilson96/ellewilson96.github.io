I feel like I write this to start off every blog post, but wow - I can't believe I made it!

For the last 12 months, I have been in college, working full-time, and enrolled in the Online Web Developer Program. There were times where I felt unmotivated, but I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this program and I've learned more than I ever thought would be possible in 12 months.

The React and Redux sections were probably some of the most challenging for me, mostly because I felt the content was quite arbitrary at first, with terms like "store," "state," "props," feeling so foreign. It felt almost impossible to keep up with all of this new information, but I felt I had to keep going and eventually it would click.

It didn't click until I got to the final project - just like every other section! 

I wanted to make something relatable and fun for my final project - something I would use and something I could show off to future employers or mentors. I've always been a massive Jeopardy fan, and I used to play on the JArchive all the time and wished there was a more modern way to study the questions.

Come to my surprise, someone had made an API powered by JArchive - called JService. This confirmed my idea and I got straight to work.

I learned so much during this project I can hardly explain - it all feels like a blur. I had to reinforce so many concepts that I just didn't read enough into during the lessons, and I read hours and hours of documentation. If I was stuck on something, I would stay up studying and wake up and keep studying until I figured out the problem. 

The most challenging aspect of this project for me was the flow of data between the API, the store, and all of the components - and how state and props tied into it all. It was definitely the part that took me the longest. I just couldn't connect the dots until I found [this article](https://medium.com/@ajaykarwal/react-application-data-flow-with-redux-1ad51aa4ac45) which helped it all start to make sense.

Eventually, I figured out the flow of data, and then I had to figure out how to render my components properly. I had to handle it differently between components as they had different purposes and some had to be iterated through and some were simply presentational. 

Lastly, I learned a lot about separating concerns and refactoring code to reflect the component's purpose. I had originally done it all wrong, but after reading many interpretations of the correct way to separate container + presentational components, I am happy with my final product. 

I still plan on adding some additional features upon passing the project to make the application more realistic. Stay tuned!

Thank you for the new skills, Flatiron School!
