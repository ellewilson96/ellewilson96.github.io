In this personal essay I wanted to explain more about my experience entering the tech world, as I have had a unique, challenging journey that may resonate with anyone who is also changing career paths.

A lot of people who say they have had a unique journey have still graduated with degrees in math, science, or some sort of practical subject, which in many cases still look great in the eyes of the interviewer. 

I, however, have always been more in tune with my creative side, working in the fashion industry for the last several years and attending a fashion school for four years. I completed three internships in both luxury retail stores and in corporate offices every year from the ages of sixteen to eighteen, and at the age of nineteen I began what I thought was going to be my dream career at Opening Ceremony.

Opening Ceremony is a place that brings a diverse range of clientele - tourists and locals alike - into an environment of discovery, creativity, and innovation. At FIT, Opening Ceremony was always mentioned as a leader of the aforementioned qualities in the industry. I would visit the store just to get inspired by the variety and uniqueness of their products, and I aspired to work there for a long time.

I began my experience with Opening Ceremony as a model on their social media channels, and in June of 2016 I attended an open interview and began my journey there as a freelancer. After proving myself for a few months, I was offered a permanent Sales Assistant position. Just six months later, I was promoted to Sales Associate and also picked up a second role, where I became the Brand Specialist for the Swedish apparel company, Acne Studios. 

I excelled in sales for a long time and developed strong client success skills, which led me to become a leader in clienteling and setting an example for other associates. During the year of 2017, I was the second-top seller of the store, having been the first-top seller for eleven months out of the year.

A few months into 2018, after being a key player for a couple of years, I wanted to work on my leadership and management skills. I had enjoyed selling, but instead wanted to incorporate my experience into an angle for management. I began working as a Keyholder in April of 2018, committing half of my shifts to selling and the other half to managing. 

As somebody who likes to be committed and consistent, splitting my time between three roles became quite intense and I wanted to commit fully to store management. After several months of developing stronger leadership skills, I expressed my interest and was offered a Supervisor role. 

This was my fifth and final role at Opening Ceremony, and I will always cherish this position. It was the culmination of all of the skills I had developed over the last two-and-a-half years, and I got to manage and work with absolutely incredible coworkers. The environment in the store is so unique, high-pressure, and fast-paced, that I have learned to wear many different hats and take on any challenges that come my way. I have discovered more about my management style, and have seen it be a success in my experience managing over twenty employees per day. 

While all of this sounds exciting and fun, I was also facing a personal battle when I was in my seventh semester of FIT. 

The longer I worked in fashion, the more I was beginning to feel disillusioned and unfulfilled. I originally got into fashion because I was inspired by the incredible designers and their methods of creating stunning art with their designs - in particular, Alexander McQueen. It is truly astounding how many hours of work are put towards the embroidery, beading, tailoring, and sourcing of just one runway garment. I loved seeing designers that Opening Ceremony helped launch reach new levels of success, especially in this time of pushing for more diversity in the industry.

However, I was first-hand witnessing the wastefulness and superficiality that runs this industry. Fashion is still the second-most polluting industry after oil, and FIT continued to push forward a focus on sustainability which led me to feel more disheartened. 

This is where I began my discovery of a world that has always been a part of my 22-year-long life; the tech industry. 

I spent hours in the FIT library on Reddit researching unbiased reviews of web development bootcamps, and the more I learned about the idea of these programs, the more it seemed to be perfect for my circumstance. The challenge of being a woman coming from a completely different industry was exciting and motivating to me, and I wanted to challenge myself to do it. 

Obviously this was an expensive decision, so after getting accepted and landing a scholarship, I settled on the Flatiron School. They offered a self-paced, online, remote program that fit in with my FIT and work schedules, as I could simply work on the labs and lessons from home whenever I had time. A lot of bootcamps are compressed into a few months of full-time hours, but since I had Brooklyn rent to pay, I was not in a position to quit my job and I had to finish my degree. As a result, it took me about a year to finish the program.

The year of 2018 was probably the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I finished my Bachelor’s Degree in Fashion Business Management with a 3.75 GPA and a minor in International Trade and Marketing. 

In April and October were my management role changes at Opening Ceremony, so by October I was working a salaried, full-time job while in my final few months of the bootcamp.

As the year went by, although I had sacrificed my social life and free time, my passions had completely shifted. While I did mostly enjoy going to work, I was more excited to get home and continue working on labs and projects. I spent every free hour I had on fine-tuning my portfolio and researching roles I would potentially be interested in upon graduating.

I was able to be so much more creative than I imagined. As somebody who loves to paint and draw, I saw there was a commonality between the two fields. Software development is just like creating art, except all of the resources for creating your ideas are right at your fingertips - literally. Instead of having to make a mess with paint or start a new canvas if you mess up, coding is mess-free and easy-to-fix. It is a limitless method of creating. 

I am also lucky that there is so much documentation and so many resources available. I watched countless Youtube tutorials and enrolled in a variety of Udemy and other online courses to supplement my studies. I am definitely more of a visual learner, so I found it useful to find tutorials that show the user live coding with a voiceover. Live is great because it shows the mistakes or deletions or second-guessing, rather than an edited tutorial that does not show any mistakes. 

Finally, in January of 2019, I graduated from the Flatiron School! 

After graduating, students are paired with a career counselor as we begin the job search. Part of my incentive to join the Flatiron School was that they had a money-back guarantee, where if you do not find a job in six months, you get your entire tuition refunded. Unfortunately, I already knew I would not be able to remain qualified as this guarantee was more directed towards students with full-time hours available to commit to their job search. I also felt confident enough at this point that I would be able to find something, so I didn’t mind taking the risk of potentially not finding a job and losing out on tuition.

One of the most difficult aspects of completing the program and beginning my search was finding time to continue learning while also applying for jobs. For every interview or role I applied for, there were different skills, languages, and technologies that I would have to be familiar with. No two company seemed to have the same stack. Not only that, but I knew I had to brush up on the skills I had learned at Flatiron by continuing to come up with new projects or ways of studying. There were elements of the program that I needed a better understanding of, and the more interviews I went on, the more I understood what needed improvement. This would include topics like computer science fundamentals, application deployment, DNS routing, React and Redux data flow; things which I had to study or figure out on my own time. 

Not only were there technical challenges while interviewing, I also had to continuously prove to employers that they could take me seriously based on my job experience. I knew it would be an uphill battle landing a job in tech, but I definitely didn’t see the following experience coming. 

I had attended a job fair at Flatiron School which essentially was like speed-dating with employers. You have three twenty-minute interviews over three days, which gives you three chances to land an on-site interview with one of the companies. 

I was beyond excited to have made it to an on-site interview for an internship which would be just a few days later. There would be two interviews - one technical and one behavioral - as well as a technical challenge that I’d be given an hour to work on. I left feeling like I could have done better on the challenge, but that overall I did my best and if it didn’t work out, I was okay with that. 

A few days after the interview, I received a response confirming that another candidate was offered the internship, so I accepted the rejection and continued on my search.



A month later, I received an email from my technical interviewer saying the following:

![](http://i66.tinypic.com/3535pig.png)


I could not believe my would-have-been boss emailed me from his personal email to ask me on a date. Not only that, but I was never in contact with him directly, only two other employees of the company who scheduled my interview. There were two possibilities of how he got my email: he somehow found my resume from one month ago, or his two coworkers passed along my information. Either way, I could not believe that this fear of mine regarding working in a male-dominated industry had been confirmed, and for a second I wondered if I actually was better off sticking with fashion. 

After several more interviews, I just was not having any luck. 

As you can imagine, managing over twenty people in a destination store five days a week (and retail hours are not fun!) made it challenging to find the time to put the effort I needed to put in to this job search. 

In mid-April, I quit my job. I decided that in order to get where I wanted to be, I would have to take a risk and pursue this search full-time. I could not believe that after three years of working at my dream company, I was now pursuing a career in tech and was quitting that job to do it. However, I knew this was the right decision and shortly after I quit, I embraced my new path and refused to look back.

Being home all the time as a Capricorn is pleasant at times, but not when unemployed. I was spending every minute of everyday refreshing every job site, applying to anything I could potentially be qualified for. I was continuing my education and filled a couple of notebooks with endless notes on algorithms, array methods, data structures, and so much more. I felt like a new job must be around the corner because I was putting 100% effort into making it happen.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work that way, and I received countless rejections. After my experience in February, I also had to be picky about the type of company I wanted to work for. I preferred a smaller company with an interesting product that also cares about its company culture, both in terms of work-life balance and diversity initiatives. 

I spent hours applying to hundreds of companies and after six weeks, four companies invited me to on-site interviews. I didn’t make it to the next round of the first two companies. The third interview I was convinced I was going to get. I had to complete a task in the company’s software platform and present my approach to two senior Solution Architects, as well as their VP of Customer Success. I was beyond disappointed to find out I did not get the role, but I was incredibly proud of myself for taking on a challenging technical presentation.

The fourth interview was my last lead. I knew that if I didn’t land this job, it was back to square one, and I was running out of time (and money).

From the very first phone call, I got a fantastic impression of the company and it only got better from there. At this point, I felt as though every opportunity was potential for another rejection, so it was hard to continue to show confidence to my interviewers. I had a phone interview shortly after and made it to the next step - a set of on-site interviews. I spent two hours with four different interviewers, each higher in the team hierarchy, and left feeling positive but again, I did not want to get my hopes up. 

I was in the middle of taking a nap when I received a voicemail from the technical recruiter to let me know that they would be offering me the position. I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t believe it. I interviewed on Friday and signed the offer letter the following Tuesday. 

I am officially an Associate Solutions Architect!

I would absolutely recommend a web development program to anybody. If you know you enjoy creating and learning on a computer for hours (and I mean HOURS), consider the investment and get those foundational skills down. There are so many roles that work with so many different backgrounds and most people will have transferable skills that will help in their learning. I invested a year and approximately $10,000 and I more than doubled my salary in just two months of solid job hunting. I have learned skills that contribute to a more sustainable and by far more inspiring industry. I will be able to continue interacting with clients while creating efficient solution designs, and most importantly, I will be immersed in a corporate technical environment with incredibly smart colleagues who will be invaluable to learn from.
